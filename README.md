# titlr
A dead simple website used for creating category tabs for Tree Style Tabs in Firefox

You can see it at https://titlr.solarnz.dev

All it does is set the window title, then store the title in the URL, which means that it is portable across multiple firefox
instances, and also works with any tab suspension plugins.
